👋 Hi! I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer, maker, and robotics lecturer. With over 15 years of experience, I love bridging the gap between hardware and firmware—designing and building real-time solutions for IoT, robotics, and tactical systems.

⚙️ I speak fluently in C/C++, Python, STM32, ESP-IDF, FreeRTOS, Embedded Linux, and ROS/ROS 2, focusing on low-level debugging and sensor data pipelines.

🧠 Passionate about mentoring young engineers and turning new ideas into working circuits that move, sense, and connect. Always exploring the frontier where the physical and digital worlds meet.
